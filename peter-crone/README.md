## Quotes
- All these quotes are from Peter Crone.

“Life will present you with people and circumstances to reveal where you’re not free.”

“You’re extraordinary. Be responsible for that.”

“What happened, happened and couldn’t have happened in any other way… because it didn’t.”

“You can allow everything and everybody to be exactly the way they are, and still be completely at peace, and I’d assert that that’s the only form of real peace there is… is to allow life to be the way it is.”

“If people could understand the disservice it is to make another human being wrong in any capacity… that alone opens up an entirely new world for people of compassion, love, acceptance, and for ourselves of relief, because I don’t need for people to be a certain way for me to be okay.”

“If you don’t create a beautiful future, your brain will do it for you and it’s not good.”

“To me, real success is where I can be at peace in the midst of chaos.”

“You can allow everything and everybody to be exactly the way they are, and still be completely at peace, and I’d assert that that’s the only form of real peace there is… is to allow life to be the way it is.”

“‘Can I be comfortable in my own skin regardless of what’s going on around me?’ And that to me is the definition of true success.”

“You’re an expression of love and pure possibility.”

“Life will present you with people and circumstances to reveal where you're not free meaning if you get triggered by anything and triggered All I'm saying is you get upset you get pissed off you get scared wherever there's some kind of emotional response to external stimulus person or event that is showing where you're not okay with the situation. I'm not okay with the situation means I'm scared at some level I feel threatened. When you're not threatened you're a piece and that's so freedom and peace and vitality. These are all my gifts to people not because I have them to give If I would never have that audacity, but I do have the gift to remove what's in the way of them being exposed as our inherent nature. 

And that's a powerful things people understand, I make the distinction between that which is inherent versus that which is inherited. So the codes the programs I was talking about in the subconscious and then all the behavior adaptations there on top of the freedom that already exists, which is your birthright. I'm revealing that and to me, there is no greater gift to a human being can experience.”  -Peter Crone


DAY 4: PETER CRONE: THESE ARE ALL MY GIFTS TO PEOPLE . . . TO REMOVE WHAT'S IN THE WAY OF THEM BEING EXPOSED AS OUR INHERENT NATURE. AND THAT'S A POWERFUL THINGS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.
Peter Crone could have had a history that would have given him many reasons to not do anything with his life and just give up. How he proceeded in life however is what is amazing and attainable in our own lives if we so choose it. I came across him when I needed to hear that. It has been hard to acknowledge that for decades I lived in a prison in my own mind and its a daily battle to wake up and realize YOU deserve what is best for you. Mr. Peter Crone speaks lovely about living in a prison and opening a window to freedom. “Do we inherently allow ourselves to be free?”

“Life will present you with people and circumstances to reveal where you're not free meaning if you get triggered by anything and triggered All I'm saying is you get upset you get pissed off you get scared wherever there's some kind of emotional response to external stimulus person or event that is showing where you're not okay with the situation. I'm not okay with the situation means I'm scared at some level I feel threatened. When you're not threatened you're a piece and that's so freedom and peace and vitality. These are all my gifts to people not because I have them to give If I would never have that audacity, but I do have the gift to remove what's in the way of them being exposed as our inherent nature. 

And that's a powerful things people understand, I make the distinction between that which is inherent versus that which is inherited. So the codes the programs I was talking about in the subconscious and then all the behavior adaptations there on top of the freedom that already exists, which is your birthright. I'm revealing that and to me, there is no greater gift to a human being can experience.”  -Peter Crone

WATCH HOW TO CREATE THE LIFE YOU WERE BORN TO LIVE 
One of my favorite podcasts is of the interchange with Dr Chatterjee, Architect of your Health discussing “Creating The Life You Were Born to Live” with the Mind Architect, Peter Crone.


If you don't take care of what's going on the subconscious of people's minds, at best the term I use is you're going to be the the greatest version of your limited self. If you really get that statement it's very profound right so you you're stuck within the parameters of your blind spots, right these beliefs of inadequacy and security and scarcity which to me a universal their prime or they're very deep, then we develop survival mechanisms. Adaptations compensate And then on top of that our physiology is going to just by natural cascade reflect whatever's going on internally, which is as you know, as a doctor, usually a mild state of fight or flight, sympathetic nervous system, cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, that whole storm of hormones that really is doing us a disservice. It's affecting people sleep and weight gain, all of the things that people are dealing symptomatically on the surface, to me are a byproduct of the fact that human beings currently are designed to survive. Everything is a potential perceived threat, whether it's being what your boss is going to say, or your spouse is going to say, well, your parents are going to say, or am I going to be able to pay rent? Or am I going to be okay in the future? Am I going to realize my dreams? Am I ever going to quit smoking? Am I going to lose weight? All of these sort of unanswerable questions inspire this internal sort of fight and battle that people have. That to me is the disease the absence of ease that then manifests over time into some physical symptoms. So that's why I get super passionate about this because you can do all the work externally . .  if you don't address what's going on mentally and emotionally for somebody, at best, you're just making the window dressing look good, while the back of the shop is just on fire.” -Peter Crone
